## Your Ideas Deserve Better Than a Notes App

You're walking the dog when the perfect marketing angle hits you.

You're driving when you remember that email you've been putting off.

You're half-asleep when you finally figure out how to fix that bug.

What happens next? You either forget it, or you scramble to type a note that sits unread for weeks.

**Exec is different.** Talk. Exec listens, figures out what needs to happen, and makes it happen.

## What Exec Does

| You Say | Exec Does |
|---------|-----------|
| "Draft a tweet about our new feature launch" | ✍️ Writes it, ready for your review |
| "Fix the bug where login fails on slow networks" | 🔧 Ships the fix via Claude Code |
| "Research how Stripe handles subscription upgrades" | 🔍 Deep dive, returns a summary |
| "Build me a prototype for a habit tracker app" | 🚀 Designs, builds, and deploys it |
| "Remind me to call the accountant about Q4 taxes" | 📋 Preps what's possible, notes the rest |

**One interface. Voice in, done out.**

## How It Works

```
📱 You                              💻 Exec
   │                                    │
   ├─ "Hey Exec, [thing]"               │
   │                                    │
   │ ──────────────────────────────────>│
   │                                    │
   │                               Transcribe
   │                               Understand
   │                               Execute
   │                                    │
   │<────────── Done. ─────────────────│
```

No app switching. No formatting. No follow-up required.

Just talk like you're delegating to a human — Exec handles the rest.

## Quick Start

### Phone App

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm start
```

### Mac Workers

```bash
cd voice-listener && bun install
./start.sh
```

That's it. Record a voice note. Watch Exec work.

## Directory Structure

Everything lives under `~/ai/`:

```
~/ai/
├── CLAUDE.md                # Action execution guidelines
├── logs/                    # Execution logs (one per action run)
└── projects/
    ├── CLAUDE.md            # Shared lessons & best practices
    ├── exec/                # ← This repo
    │   ├── app/             # Expo Router pages
    │   ├── components/      # React Native UI
    │   ├── lib/             # Core business logic
    │   └── voice-listener/  # Bun workers (extraction + execution)
    ├── my-project/          # Created by voice actions
    └── ...
```

The workers resolve all paths from `~/ai/` — projects land in `~/ai/projects/`, logs go to `~/ai/logs/`.
